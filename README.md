# Baseline models
Here, the Historical Mean Baseline Model is used. The historical average of train data is calculated and applied as the predicted value for the future test set. Then, this predicted value is compared with test data to calculate the evaluation metrics, then evaluting the performance of this 'model'. This method is only the historical data of turbidity, which is the target of this case study. Rather than saying a model, this simple calculation just give a reference point for further modeling and discussion.
